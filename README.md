# Tile Windows

**UPDATE** I have not used these scripts in a while and I do not support them anymore. I use the excellent [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/ "Moom &middot; Many Tricks"), which I recommend.

A collection of Applescripts which resize and tile windows neatly over the desktop. They are best used by assigning them a keyboard shortcut, through [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/ "FastScripts") for example.

## Shortcuts

I personally use:

	Maximize Vertically   ⌃`
	
	Left                ⌃⌥⌘←
	Right               ⌃⌥⌘→
	Top                 ⌃⌥⌘↑
	Bottom              ⌃⌥⌘↓
	
	Upper Left          ⌃⌥⇧←
	Lower Left          ⌃⌥⇧↓
	Lower Right         ⌃⌥⇧→
	Upper Right         ⌃⌥⇧↑
	
	Left Third          ⌃⌥←
	Right Third         ⌃⌥→
	Upper Center Third  ⌃⌥↑
	Lower Center Third  ⌃⌥↓
	Center Third     (none)
